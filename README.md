#Trip-Itinerary
This web app was developed in under 48 hours at HackRice, Rice University's hackathon, in the fall of 2016. 
* Tools used: Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Yelp API, and Google Maps API

The website generates a list off activities based off your interests by allowing you to check everything you are interested and what city you are in. It then generates a list of cool activities to and an itinerary of what to do within the city.
